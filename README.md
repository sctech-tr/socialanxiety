## What is social anxiety?
Social anxiety is a mental health disorder that causes intense fear of social situations. It's not just being shy, it's a lot more than that. It can be very debilitating and can affect every aspect of a person's life. People with social anxiety often avoid social situations, and when they can't avoid them, they feel extremely anxious and self-conscious. They may worry about being judged, embarrassed, or humiliated, and they may have physical symptoms like sweating, blushing, or trembling. Social anxiety can be very isolating and can make it difficult to make friends, go to school or work, or even leave the house. It's a serious condition that can have a big impact on a person's life, but with the right treatment, it can be managed and even overcome.
## How can I imagine it?
Imagine being in a room full of people, and feeling like everyone is staring at you, judging you, and laughing at you. Imagine feeling like you're being watched all the time, and that everyone is talking about you behind your back. Imagine feeling like you're not good enough, and that you're a burden to everyone around you. That's what social anxiety feels like.

...or in other words, think the shyness you feel when you're about to give a presentation, multiplicate it by 100 times, and apply it to your life.

Not fun, right?
