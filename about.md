informational site about social anxiety
## why?
i want to bring more awareness to social anxiety, and help people understand it better since it's not very well known and often misunderstood. other than that, i wanted to help people explain it to others via just a link, and not have to explain it themselves via looooooooong paragraphs. i have social anxiety myself, and trust me, it's not fun.
