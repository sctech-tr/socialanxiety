# socialanxiety.vr.lt
informational site about social anxiety
## why?
i want to bring more awareness to social anxiety, and help people understand it better since it's not very well known and often misunderstood. other than that, i wanted to help people explain it to others via just a link, and not have to explain it themselves via looooooooong paragraphs. i have social anxiety myself, and trust me, it's not fun. i even get nervous talking to chatgpt lol :p

i know, the website is very simple, but i wanted to keep it simple and easy to understand. i hope you like it!
